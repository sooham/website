# Website
Work in progress.
An older version of the website is [here](http://sooham.com).

Built using:
- React.js
- Express.js and Node.js
- Draft.js
- Katex
- nginx
- Webpack and its infinite plugins and loaders
- CSS modules!

Built without any templating frameworks like bootstrap.
The website is Unversial (or isomorphic), meaning it does client-side
routing and server-side for better load times and SEO.
Written in ES6 JS.

## How to build
If you desire, you can build it right now with the following command:
`NODE_ENV=production npm start` and navigate to `localhost:8080`
